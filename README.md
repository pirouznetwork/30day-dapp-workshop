# **30-Day Blockchain Workshop: Building AI-Enhanced dApps with Solidity, Svelte, and Prom Blockchain**

## **Project Description**  
This **30-day online workshop** empowers developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using **Solidity (EVM), Svelte for frontends, and AI models** on the **Prom Blockchain**. The workshop is structured in two phases:  
- **15 Days of Tutorials:** Foundational concepts, hands-on coding, and AI integration.  
- **15 Days of Projects:** Building 15 real-world blockchain applications with AI enhancements.  

**Long-Term Vision:**  
- Repeat the workshop **every two months** to onboard new developers.  
- Expand to **universities in Iran, Tajikistan, and beyond** for global collaboration.  
- **Grant 3 top projects** for further development and funding.  

**Location:** Online (accessible worldwide). Led by **Jafar Ghorbani**, an experienced blockchain instructor based in Iran.

## **Problem Statement**  
Developers lack structured resources to combine **blockchain (Solidity/Prom), modern frontends (Svelte), and AI** in practical applications. This workshop bridges the gap with hands-on projects.  

---

## **Solution**  
The workshop will:  
1. Teach **Solidity smart contracts** on Prom Blockchain.  
2. Integrate **Svelte** for responsive frontends.  
3. Incorporate **AI models** (e.g., LLMs, prediction algorithms) into dApps.  
4. Foster a developer community via Discord/Telegram.  
5. Select **3 projects for grants** to scale post-workshop.
